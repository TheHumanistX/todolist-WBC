Need to update/change:

theme.js:
* Needed to update color palette to work with new dark color scheme... 
  * added `primary.main` because that is what input field outlines use to determine their colors when focused.
  * `background.default` same color plus added dark color scheme
  * `textColor` same colors plus added dark color scheme
  * `buttonColor` same color plus added dark color scheme
  * `cardBackgroundColor` 
    * `.main`same color plus added dark color scheme
    * `.alternate1` changed from `.alternate` and added dark color scheme
    * `.alternate2` added to handle second task/task list card color in Lists and Tasks components in dark mode.  Has same light mode color as `.main` because in original code `.main` handled one of the card colors for task and task list card colors.
    * Basically, `.main` handles the background color of Lists and Tasks components
    * `.alternate1` and `.alternate2` handle the background colors of the TaskList and Task components
